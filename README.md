# traffic-priority-simulator
simulation-based -traffic-priority-simulator

## Project Overview
A smart traffic priority system simulation that identifies available and unavailable spaces on the road and prioritizes vehicles arriving earlier.  
The system aims to improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, and optimize vehicle movement. Designed for traffic management and integration with monitoring systems.

## Features
- Highlights available road spaces (green) and unavailable spaces (red)
- Prioritizes vehicles based on arrival
- Simulates realistic traffic scenarios
- Future integration with traffic monitoring systems
- Demonstrates understanding of software engineering processes

## Purpose
- Solve traffic congestion by prioritizing vehicle movement efficiently
- Showcase skills in software engineering
- Demonstrate understanding of requirements, design, testing, and implementation
- Provide a clear simulation for traffic priority management

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate with navigation apps like Google Maps
- Add real-time traffic updates
- Expand system to handle multiple intersections simultaneously
