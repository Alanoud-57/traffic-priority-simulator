# Traffic Priority Simulator

## 1.1 Introduction
The Traffic Priority Simulator is a simulation-based system designed to manage road traffic efficiently. It visualizes road spaces and assigns priority to vehicles based on their arrival, helping reduce congestion.

## 1.2 Motivation
Urban traffic congestion causes delays and inefficiency. Current systems do not provide real-time visual guidance for drivers, and there is a need for a smart system to manage road spaces effectively.

## 1.3 Problem Statement
Vehicles face delays due to inefficient prioritization. Drivers lack visual guidance for available spaces and correct order, leading to traffic jams and confusion. This project addresses these challenges with a simulation-based solution.

## 1.4 Project Objectives
- Visualize available and unavailable road spaces.  
- Assign priority to vehicles based on arrival time.  
- Update the display in real-time during simulation.  
- Provide a framework for analyzing traffic flow.  

## 1.5 Project Scope
- Focused on *simulation only*, not a real-time system.  
- Database storage is *not required at this stage*.  
- Demonstrates software engineering skills and traffic management concepts.  

## 1.6 Proposed Solution
- Capture road layout and vehicle positions.  
- Assign priority to vehicles based on arrival time.  
- Display available spaces (green) and unavailable spaces (red).  
- Log traffic violations for future analysis (optional).  

## 1.7 Project Contribution
- Showcases skills in *software engineering, system design, and project management*.  
- Provides a practical simulation framework for understanding traffic prioritization.  

## 1.8 Project Organization
- *Repository Structure*:
  - requirements/ → Functional & Non-Functional + Hardware + Software requirements  
  - design/ → User view, system flow, diagrams (UML, flowcharts)  
  - implementation/ → Simulation code (to be added)  
  - testing/ → Test cases and simulation results  
- README files in each folder explain the contents clearly.
