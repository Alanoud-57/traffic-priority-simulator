Non-Functional Requirements – Traffic Priority Simulator
	1.	Performance
* The system must update the display of road spaces (green, yellow, red) in real-time with minimal delay.
* Simulation should run smoothly for up to 20 vehicles simultaneously.

———
	2.	Reliability
* The system must accurately calculate vehicle priorities and path assignments at all times.
* All events and changes in the simulation (vehicle movements, square color changes) must be logged consistently without errors.

———
	3.	Usability
* The HUD (Head-Up Display) projection on the car’s front windshield should clearly show green and red squares.
* Users should understand traffic flow at a glance without needing additional instructions.

———
	4.	Scalability
* The system should handle a variable number of vehicles: minimum 2 vehicles, maximum 20 vehicles.
* Capable of managing more complex road layouts in future versions.

———
	5.	Maintainability
* Code should be modular, clean, and well-documented for easy future updates.
* README and folder structure should clearly explain each component of the project.

———
	6.	Portability
* The simulation should run on standard desktops or laptops without requiring specialized hardware.
* Compatible with common operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

———
	7.	Safety (Simulation-Only)
* The system is fully virtual; users only observe the results on the HUD.
* No real-world vehicle control is possible.

———
	8.	Simulation Accuracy
* Vehicle priorities, path decisions, and color updates must reflect realistic traffic flow scenarios in the simulation.

———
	9.	Error Logging
* All unexpected actions or anomalies in the simulation must be recorded internally for debugging or analysis.

———
	10.	Resource Usage
* The simulation should run efficiently without consuming excessive system memory or CPU, even at maximum vehicle count (20 vehicles).
