                                    Functional Requirements – Traffic Priority Simulator

1. System Startup
	•	The system shall start the traffic simulation automatically when launched.

⸻

2. Route Selection
	•	The user shall select a desired route or destination before starting the simulation.
	•	Future Scope: Integration with Google Maps to determine real locations and calculate priority (not implemented).

⸻

3. Pre-Simulation Settings (Simulation Mode)
	•	The system shall allow the user to select the road type (Short Route or General Route).
	•	The system shall allow setting an estimated time of arrival (ETA) for simulation analysis.

⸻

4. Green Path Movement
	•	Vehicles shall move only through green squares based on calculated priority.

⸻

5. Yellow Path Waiting
	•	Vehicles shall stop at yellow squares until they become green.

⸻

6. Red Path Restriction
	•	Red squares shall represent occupied road spaces by other vehicles.
	•	Red squares shall not turn green while occupied.

⸻

7. Real-Time Simulation Updates
	•	The system shall dynamically update square colors (green, yellow, red) based on vehicle movement and priority.

⸻

8. Automatic Priority Calculation
	•	The system shall automatically calculate vehicle priority when multiple vehicles arrive simultaneously.

⸻

9. Event Logging (System-Internal)
	•	The system shall internally log simulation events, including:
	•	Vehicle entering a square
	•	Waiting at yellow squares
	•	Priority decisions
	•	Arrival at destination
	•	Logs shall not be visible to the user.

⸻

10. Red-Square Violation Counter
	•	The system shall count and record any attempt to enter a red square as a violation.

⸻

11. Visual Road Status Display
	•	The system shall visually display road status using green and red indicators.
	•	The user shall observe traffic behavior without interacting with the system.

⸻

12. Elapsed Travel Time
	•	The system shall calculate the total travel time for each vehicle.

⸻

13. Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)
	•	The system shall provide an estimated arrival time before starting the simulation.

⸻

14. Speed Recommendation Based on Traffic Density
	•	The system shall recommend an appropriate vehicle speed based on traffic congestion.
	•	Speed recommendations shall vary according to the number of red and green squares.
	•	Speed recommendations are advisory and applied only within the simulation.

⸻

15. Emergency Priority Mode (Simulation Only)
	•	The system shall support an emergency priority mode for high-priority vehicles within the simulation.
	•	When activated, the system shall recalculate priorities to allow faster route clearance.
	•	This mode is for analytical and simulation purposes only.

⸻

16. HUD Display on Front Windshield
	•	The system shall project simulation visuals onto the front windshield (HUD).
	•	The system shall be compatible with vehicles without touchscreen displays.
	•	The entire display shall remain virtual and simulation-based.

⸻

17. Algorithm Implementation Note
	•	The system may use Depth-First Search (DFS) or tree-based search algorithms to determine paths and priorities.
